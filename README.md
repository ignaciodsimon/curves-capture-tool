# curves-capture-tool
Complete application for capturing data sets from images.

This application is made in C++ for Windows. A previous and (not as complete) Python version I made can be found at: https://github.com/ignaciodsimon/PlotCaptureTool

If you just want the compiled binary, get this: https://github.com/ignaciodsimon/curves-capture-tool/blob/master/Windows/CurvesCaptureTool.exe
